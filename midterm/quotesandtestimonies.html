        <div class="grid-item">"When he asked me, "Why are you wearing a different perfume?" He already had his own answer, because it was Tuesday and I was going to class with a male professor.

        <div class="grid-item">"I have always wanted to be a teacher, it was my vocation. The kids I teach always tell me stories and about their day. Once a child told me, "Teacher!

        <div class="grid-item">"I can drive long distances in a car by myself in the US. For example, I can drive from San Diego to Los Angeles without a problem. In Mexico, there is no way I can drive long distances by myself. I could be kidnapped or stopped for no reason" -Isabel Duclaud </div>
        <div class="grid-item">"I have a family member that said that he is angry with feminists because they are highliting a problem that everyone faces, not just women. He says that men are also killed and that they can also be harrased" -Hayley Mogollon</div>
